# Restaurant Menu Project

Utilizes Flask and SQL Alchemy to generate a database for Restaurants, Menu Items, and website Users.

Users can log in via Facebook or Google Plus. In order to add a restaurant, the user must be logged in. Restaurants and their menus can only be edited by the user who created them, or the first user created on the database after the dummy user (user ID 2). User ID 2 acts as a Moderator to protect the application quickly and without the need to alter the code. Alternatively, the templates can be modified to grant this ability to a user with a specific email.
